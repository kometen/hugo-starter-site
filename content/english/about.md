My name is Claus Guttesen, live near a small town called Sandane in the western part of Norway. I work
as a developer at The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, where Java is an essential part. I also work with
databases where PostgreSQL is a favourite. Then some Elasticsearch, and place code into containers.

In previous positions I worked as a UNIX-admin, network-design, automating manual tasks, shell-scripting,
Ruby, Perl, C, C++, Javascript.

I like to excercise in my sparetime. Cross-country (skating) during the winter if we have snow. Run and
walk outside winter.
